## About Me üöÄ

I'm an avid learner with a strong interest in science and a background in competitive swimming. I hold an associate's degree in web development and am currently pursuing a bachelor's in cybersecurity, which I continue to build upon with real-world projects and hands-on exercises.

I had the unique experience of participating in the cyberwarfare component of **Northern Strike**, where I honed my skills in defensive and offensive security strategies. Currently, I'm working on a comprehensive cybersecurity application, **Aegis**, aimed at providing both Blue Team and Red Team tools in a project-based workflow environment.
