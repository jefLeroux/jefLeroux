# Hi there, I’m Jef Leroux 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate cybersecurity professional and developer, always excited to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge. Here, you'll find my projects centered around cybersecurity, web development, and machine learning.

## About Me 🚀

I'm an avid learner with a strong interest in science and a background in competitive swimming. I hold an associate's degree in web development and am currently pursuing a bachelor's in cybersecurity, which I continue to build upon with real-world projects and hands-on exercises.

I had the unique experience of participating in the cyberwarfare component of **Northern Strike**, where I honed my skills in defensive and offensive security strategies. Currently, I'm working on a comprehensive cybersecurity application, **Aegis**, aimed at providing both Blue Team and Red Team tools in a project-based workflow environment.

## Current Projects 🛠️

### Aegis

**Aegis** is an Electron-based cybersecurity app, built with C++ for backend speed and TypeScript in the frontend. It's designed to support both API-based and command-line workflows, providing tools for both offensive and defensive measures. Aegis includes:

- Project-based workflows for organized Red Team/Blue Team assessments
- Detailed and overview reports with space for manually inserted steps
- Node.js integration with a C++ API fuzzer for rigorous endpoint testing
- PostgreSQL database setup for future deployment possibilities
- And many many more coming soon!

### Machine Learning in C

A series of machine learning algorithms implemented in C, exploring the fundamentals of machine learning models at the ground level with a focus on performance and resource efficiency.

### Personal Website

A professional resume website with a tech-themed, terminal-style design. It features interactive project cards, hoverable logos for skill representation, and downloadable resume functionality.
